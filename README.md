# Sentiment_Analysis_with_Dictionary_and_ML
 
This is a course project to analyse sentiment of Ecommerce comments in Chinese.

Used 2 approaches to tackle the task:
1) Used ready-to-use sentiment dictionary to give scores to the comments, and optimised the dictionary to fit the Ecommerce field. Develop my own algorithm although the accuracy was not the best.
2) Used SVM model to predict the sentiment score
